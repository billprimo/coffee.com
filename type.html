                Cappuccinos are a fan favorite when visiting coffee shops. This is especially the case because of the latte art decorations that are often drawn into the steamed milk foam.

            <p>
                This popular drink is made by layering a balanced ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam in that order. This is to ensure the cappuccinosâ€™ bold and rich flavors, as well as to maintain its thick, foamy texture. It is common to add flavored syrups and other toppings, such as chocolate powder, to further sweeten the deal.
            </p>
            <p>

                Espresso is not necessarily a type of coffee, but a way to make coffee. The difference is the amount of water used to make espressos versus regularly brewed coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because they are made with a shot of water instead of a liter of water per cup of ground coffee, espressos are basically highly concentrated coffee. Because of this, you can expect espressos to have a more heightened array of flavors compared to your regular cup of coffee.            </p>
            <p>
                This can mean stronger, toastier, and more bitter cups, which flavors that will be amplified depending on the coffee roast. Regardless, you can expect thicker and creamier textures than coffee, almost like what you see with cappuccinos.

                Like with other variations of coffee, there are health benefits when drinking a cup or two a day, and with the added benefit of having little to no calories. <br>Espressos are packed with antioxidants, providing ample protection against infections. Drinking espressos every day can also provide a significant improvement in your concentration and memory.            </p>

                Thanks to their versatility in customization, Lattes are among the most popular coffee choices. Anything from sweet to herbal can be added to them, and latte art can be added to complete the drink. Lattes are similar to cappuccinos because they are also made with espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.            </p>
            <p>
                The ratio of ingredients is what separates the two drinks; however: while cappuccinos have equal ratios, lattes have more steamed milk. The ingredients in lattes are also mixed together instead of being layered, like what can be found in cappuccinos. Compared to cappuccinos and the many other espresso-based drinks, lattes are not very strong in taste.<br>

                This is because they are heavier with milk than coffee. Due to being milkier than their counterparts, they are sweeter than most coffee, though still not as sweet as you will find in mochas.            </p>
            <p>
                This especially becomes the case when shots of flavor, such as pumpkin spice or hazelnut, are added. Also, while cappuccinos are frothy due to the milk foam, lattes are creamy and smooth thanks to the extra helping of steamed milk.<br>

                A cup a day can aid in burning fat, and with more natural flavors such as beetroot or turmeric, you can improve your memory and relieve muscle aches.            </p>

                An iced latte is a fairly simple drink to make, similar to an iced coffee. To make iced lattes, you just need to blend a chilled espresso drink, the desired amount of sweetener, milk, and ice.            <p>
                Ideally, a cold coffee brewed best is one that has little to no bitterness or sourness and is the smoothest coffee you will ever enjoy.<br>

                Once the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, you can pour the final product into a glass and add whipped cream if desired. You know it is just right because it will taste like a milder version of its hotter counterpart, the regular latte. It will still be very sweet, but it will not be as creamy as the hotter coffee type.            <p>
                It is also naturally sweeter than the hot coffee types, requiring fewer additives to improve the taste.<br>
                Also, like its hotter counterpart, iced lattes can be a healthy beverage. It mainly depends on the kind of milk you choose, and how much syrup you add for flavor. Also, iced lattes will be stronger than regular coffee thanks to the shot of espresso used to make them.<br>

                The benefits to be gained from iced lattes are the same with hot lattes, such as an increased focus and metabolism rates. The main difference is the reduced acid reflux when drinking the colder coffee type.          </div>
