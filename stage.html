            <h2>Let's start learning the stages of coffee!!</h2>
            <p><b>=>Coffee Roasting Stages:<br>
                So the process of roasting coffee beans is not as simple as just exposing the green coffee beans to heat and hoping they will turn out great.<br> <u>Coffee roasters take pride in hand-crafting these coffee beans as the whole process is pretty delicate. 

                With that in mind, the coffee roasting stages can be divided into 6 phases which are</u><br>
                
                1. Drying Phase<br>


                
                2. Maillard Phase<br>
                
                3. Caramelisation Phase<br>
                
                4. First Crack<br>
                
                5. Development Phase<br>
                
                6. Second Crack</b</p>
        </div>
        <div class="layer two">
            <h2>Stage 1 – Drying Phase </h2>
            <p><b>=>Coffee processing involves drying out the coffee beans in the sun over a week. However, the green coffee beans will not be completely dry and one would expect approximately 10% moisture left in the coffee beans. 

                Hence, the first part of the coffee roasting process is to remove moisture. <br>
                
                The coffee roasting machine will first be preheated up to approximately 200oC (392oF) before green coffee beans are loaded into the drum. <br>From here on, the coffee beans undergo an endothermic phase where heat is absorbed and the water will start to evaporate. <br>
                
                Physically, the drying phase will change the green coffee beans into a yellow hue and the mass of the coffee beans will gradually drop as their moisture content reduces.<br>
                
                Generally, roasters will not rush through the phase of drying to ensure proper heat distribution throughout the coffee bean. <br>Progressing to the next coffee roasting stage with a short drying phase will result in underdeveloped coffee beans while the extended drying phase will cause overdevelopment of the coffee beans. Both of which will have undesired flavors. <br>
                
                As a guide, the drying phase usually lasts about 30% to 50% of the total roasting time (Approximately 4 to 8 minutes).<br> I will discuss more on the development phase below.</b> </p>
        </div>
        <div class="layer three">
            <h2>Stage 2 – Maillard Phase  </h2>
            <p>=>So what happens to the coffee beans during the Maillard phase?<br>

                During the Maillard phase, sugars get broken down and react with amino acids to form a myriad of flavor and aromatic compounds. <br>Since coffee beans from different regions have different compositions of sugars and amino acids, they will eventually form different flavor compounds during this phase.<br>
                
                Hence, this results in many interesting flavors of coffee.<br>I’ve written a piece on the flavor notes of coffee if you are interested to know more!<br>
                
                And of course, you will start to get a whiff of the intoxicating pleasant aroma of coffee due to the Maillard reaction on the coffee beans.<br> During this phase, the coffee bean’s temperature would have risen to approximately 250oC – 300oF (121oC – 149oC).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="layer for">
            <h2>Stage 3 – Caramelisation Phase</h2>
              <p>As the coffee roasting stage progresses from the Maillard phase, the caramelization phase will kick in as the coffee bean temperature approaches the range of 340oF (171oC). <br>

                The sugars caramelization process will gradually put a halt to the Maillard phase as it degrades sugars which are supposed to facilitate the Maillard reaction.<br> Here, roasters will usually prolong this phase to develop flavor profiles such as nutty and caramel. <br>
                
                In terms of color, the coffee bean will have now changed from a yellow hue to a light brown color.<br> The coffee beans are finally looking like the coffee beans we are familiar with!<br>
                
                These coffee beans will also start to shed the outer layer which is known as the silver skin (also known as the chaff).<br> This may give rise to a potential fire hazard as the silver skin may catch fire and burn up in the roasting drum. <br>As such, coffee roasters must ensure adequate airflow through the roasting drum to vent out the silver skin and smoke. 
                
                </p>

        </div>

        <div class="layer five">
            <h2>Stage 4 – First Crack</h2>
            <p><b>=>The first 3 coffee roasting stages, it is pretty uneventful other than having to monitor the bean temperature and color change over time. All of this changes when the First Crack stage happens which is at 196oC. <br>

                During the drying phase, the steam builds up within the core of the coffee bean causing a rise in internal pressure.<br> Aside from steam, Carbon Dioxide gas molecules from within the beans receive heat energy during roasting and are now excited to move around. <br>
                
                Consequently, the pressure combination from both steam and Carbon Dioxide will tear through the surface of the coffee beans.<br> This results in a pop-corn popping sound in the roasting drum. <br>
                
                As this happens, the size of the coffee beans will increase slightly due to heat expansion and also due to steam and carbon dioxide causing internal cracks within the coffee bean. Color-wise, the brown color is more developed from the Caramelisation phase.<br>
                
                The chaff of the coffee beans will also rapidly be shed by the “violent” popping action and smoke generation will intensify in this stage. <br>For this reason, a vent and also good internal ventilation of the roasting room is of utmost importance.<br>
                
                If the roaster decides to stop the roast at this point, the coffee bean roast level is known as a City Roast (Medium Roast Region).</b> </p>
        </div>

        <div class="layer six">
            <h2>Stage 5 – Development Phase</h2>
            <p>=>The Development Phase is the phase where the coffee roaster’s experience plays an important role. <br>

                However, you must know that the development phase is not a defined period within the coffee roasting stages progression.<br> Instead, the development phase is a phase that happens concurrently with the other roasting stages.<br>
                
                In other words, every stage that was described before this plays a role in developing the flavors of the coffee beans.<br>
                
                That said, most roasters would agree that the development phase is the phase right after the First Crack. <br>Post-first crack, roasters will try to control the temperature of the beans to be relatively stable to develop the coffee beans.<br>
                
                Underdeveloping the coffee beans will cause the core temperature of the coffee beans to be cooler than the exterior.<br> Consequently, brewing coffee from this batch will exhibit sour coffee flavors which are not desirable. <br>
                
                On the contrary, overdeveloping the coffee beans will destroy most of the flavor compounds. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="layer seven">
            <h2>Stage 6 – Second Crack </h2>
            <p>=>Right after the First Crack, further roasting the coffee beans will then cause the second build-up of Carbon Dioxide gas within the coffee bean’s core.<br> Since the First Crack ruptured the internals and surface of the coffee bean, the Second Crack is naturally not as loud and pronounced as the First Crack..<br> 

                Nonetheless, an important indicator to tell the roaster that the coffee roast levels are now approaching the Dark Roast region..<br> 
                
                As the structure of the coffee bean is weakened, this allows coffee oils within the core to seep out as the roasting process approaches the Second Crack. .<br> Physically, coffees that are roasted to the Second Crack phase will have a dark brown color and a distinct layer of oil on their surface. .<br> 
                
                In terms of flavor, you should expect all the natural flavors and characteristics of the coffee bean to be lost..<br>  Instead, they have now been replaced with bold bitter smoky flavors with minimal acidity. </p>
