            Let’s start with the basics: all of the drinks in this guide contain two basic ingredients: espresso and milk. Some of the milk is steamed, some is left cold.

            When I say steamed milk, I am referring to cold milk that has been steamed with a high-pressure wand on an espresso machine. The wand forces hot air in between the milk’s proteins, warming it up and creating a fine microfoam on the surface.
            
            Many espresso drinks contain sugar, flavored syrups, or even cream instead of milk. We’ll talk about some of these as well.
            
            Most coffee shops put a standard double shot of espresso in every espresso and milk drink, no matter the size. So when you’re determining the size, you’re usually just deciding how much milk you want.<b>LATTE</b>: latte is the largest and milkiest of the espresso and milk drinks. This makes it the most approachable. Everyone loves a simple, smooth flavored latte - even people who don’t really like coffee. The low concentration of espresso blends pretty well with sweet flavor syrups such as vanilla or mocha.

            Lattes usually contain 1-2 ounces of espresso and 8-15 ounces of steamed milk. In the specialty coffee world, anything larger than 8 ounces is considered a latte.<a>CAPPUCCINO</a>: cappuccino is the most famous espresso and milk drink around the world. No matter where your travels take you, you’ll be able to find one. It’s not uncommon to find two or three latte sizes.Traditionally, cappuccinos were only 5-6 ounce beverages made with 1-2 ounces of espresso and 3-4 ounces of steamed milk. The milk was steamed so that as much as ⅓ of the drink was thick microfoam.<a href="https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/espresso/guide-to-common-espresso-and-milk-drinks">Click on the link!</a>
