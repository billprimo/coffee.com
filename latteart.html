                <p>First, you need to pour enough cold milk (at 1˚C or 34˚F) for one cup into your steam pitcher.maintain the motion until the milk heats to between 65˚C and 68˚C (150˚F and 155˚F), and don’t let the foamed milk reach 71˚C (160˚F).Give the milk a few seconds to settle so it can have a more velvety texture, and then swirl it vigorously. If you notice any bubbles, pound the pitcher on the counter multiple times before continuing to swirl for 20 – 30 seconds.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftzwByCgNUY">Click on the link!</a></p>

               <h2>HISTORY-TECHNIQUE</h2>
                <p>Latte art developed independently in different countries, following the introduction of espresso and the development of microfoam, the combination of crema (which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee) and microfoam allowing the pattern; it presumably was initially developed in Italy.Latte art requires first producing espresso with crema and microfoam, and then combining these to make latte art. See microfoam: procedure for how microfoam is made; this article concentrates on the latte art once the foam is made.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art">More Information!</a>  </p>
